1. Fireball Game Editor
===================
- Project Name：Fireball Game Editor
- Company:  Firebox Technology Co., Ltd. 
- Site：[en](http://fireball-x.com/en) [中文](http://fireball-x.com)
- Video: [Fireball Editor built with Polymer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U9Ojc8Babc)
- Summary

>Fireball is a Hackable editor that combines power of full GUI toolset and popular open sourced game engine such as Pixi.js and Cocos2D-JS to create cross-platform mobile and HTML5 games.

>Fireball uses Polymer to build the whole editor front end. The UI elements we created is not just for Fireball's core editor, we'd also like our users to be able to reuse Fireball's custom-elements or even build their own elements to extend the editor UI and create tools to fit their exact needs. So we need to make sure there are no CSS pollution between core panels and user created panels. Shadow DOM technology used by Polymer is by far the best solution for our need.

>Polymer utilizes the power of Custom Element, Shadow DOM and Data Binding without importing irrelevant functions. The design pattern is on the same track as Fireball. Fireball aims to use HTML5 web development technology (Elements, Styles, Data Attributes) to create the core of a powerful but flexible Editor UI system, and Polymer is the wheel we don't have to reinvent.


2. Credit Bank
===================
- Project Name: Credit Bank
- Company: Wandoulabs

Some amounts of reward, called *Credit*, will be paid to the employee who successfully execute the *Mission*, depending on the cost and degree of difficulty of the *Mission* and these *Credit* can be used to exchange for some other prizes and gifts.

>The design of *Credit Bank* is enlightened by [topeka](https://polymer-topeka.appspot.com/).  The whole project mainly used *core / paper elements* of Polymer and totally use *Material Design* for reference. Some fancy animation effects, more specifically, are achieved with *core-animated-pages*.

3. Test Platform for Android Apps
===================
- Project Name: Test Platform for Android Apps
- Company: Wandoulabs
- Site: Private
- Vidoe: [Test platform built with Polymer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A51O3njdi8s)

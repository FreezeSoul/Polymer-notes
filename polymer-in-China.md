1. Fireball Game Editor
===================
- 项目名称：Fireball Game Editor

- 项目简介

>Fireball is a Hackable editor that combines power of full GUI toolset and popular open sourced game engine such as Pixi.js and Cocos2D-JS to create cross-platform mobile and HTML5 games.

>Fireball is an editor framework for game development. We focus on creating the most accessible and feature reach GUI toolset in one single editor with HTML and JavaScript. On the runtime side, Fireball uses other popular open sourced game engines such as Pixi.js and Cocos2D-JS. This makes Fireball really easy to get into for game engine users. Users will keep the benefit of all the features, packing and optimization of other game engines, but with a better editor much more can be achieved.

>The editor design is deeply inspired by Unity which we believe has the most advanced game developing editor at the moment. Fireball advances in editor and tool extendability thanks to modern Web technology. We use a combination of Polymer, Electron, Nodejs and plain-old HTML and CSS. Web developers can easily hack the editor and create tools that empowers your workflow in no time.
